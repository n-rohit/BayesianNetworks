# Bayesian Networks
- Bayesian Networks are a part of the pgmpy models which are used for representing Uncertainity within the Machine Learning Model.
- They are a type of <b>Probabilistic Graphical Model</b> comprised of nodes and directed edges.
- The Bayesian framework for machine learning states that you start out by enumerating all reasonable models of the data and assigning your prior belief P(M) to each of these models. Then, upon observing the data D, you evaluate how probable the data was under each of these models to compute P(D|M).
- It is a statistical model where you use probability to represent all uncertainty within the model, both the uncertainty regarding the output but also the uncertainty regarding the input (aka parameters) to the model.
